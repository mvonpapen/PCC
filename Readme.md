# Phase Coherence Classification

The wavelet-based phase coherence classification decomposes signals such as the local field potential in electrophysiological recordings into subsignals depending on the pairwise phase-coherence relations. It then computes the power spectral densities of these subsignals thus allowing a detailed spectral analysis. For a detailed description see [von Papen et al., Phase-coherence classification: a new wavelet-based method to separate local field potentials into local (in)coherent and volume-conducted components, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 2017](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027017303035).

The wavelet transform is applied using a modified code originally provided by [Torrence & Compo](http://paos.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/). The modified code allows to perform the wavelet analysis for any given frequency instead of a logarithmically equidistant set of frequencies.

## Test example
plot_synth_data.m generates a PCC of synthetic data as presented in Fig. 7 of [von Papen et al. (2017)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027017303035). The example requires the [mseb plotting function by Andreas Trier Poulsen](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47950-mseb-x-y-errbar-lineprops-transparent-?focused=3861325&tab=function).
